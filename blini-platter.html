                <p> Sift flours, yeast and 1 tsp salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre.
                  Place milk and creme fraiche in a small saucepan over low heat and warm gently until lukewarm. Add milk mixture to the well in the flour mixture, along with the egg yolk, then stir until a soft dough. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour or until small bubbles appear on the surface
                  Whisk the eggwhite until soft peaks form, then gently fold into the batter.
                  Heat a large non-stick frypan over medium-low heat and brush with a little butter. In batches, using 1/2-1 tbs batter for each blini, add batter to the frypan, then cook for 2 minutes or until small bubbles appear on the surface. Turn and cook for a further 1 minute or until golden.
                  Transfer to a plate while you cook the remaining blinis, brushing the pan with more butter in between batches.
                  Place blinis on a serving platter, then serve with a selection of toppings for guests to assemble their own.</p>
